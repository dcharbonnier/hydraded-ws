     * - **Blob**
     * Specifying a Blob enqueues the blob's raw data to be transmitted in a binary frame. The value of bufferedAmount
     * is increased by the byte size of that raw data.
     * - **ArrayBufferView**

     * buffer, increasing the value of bufferedAmount by the requisite number of bytes.
